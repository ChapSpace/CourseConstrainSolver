# CourseConstrainSolver
A constrain solver for course planning

## Development

Best practice for development is to create a new branch for whatever you're working on (titled `[your name]/[what you're working on]`, and then make a PR when it's done.
```
git checkout -b [BRANCH NAME]
```

Example:
```
git checkout -b ali/test-cases
```

We should strive to have PRs reviewed by one other member on the team before they are ready to be merged into main.
