# Getting Started

Clone the repo into your preferred directory
```
cd [YOUR PROJECT LOCATION]
git clone https://github.com/ChapSpace/CourseConstrainSolver.git
```

CD into the repo and open
```
cd CourseConstrainSolver
code .
```

Create your virtual environment
```
python -m venv .venv
```

Once you've created your virtual environment, you will need to activate it whenever you want to run your code
```
.venv/Scripts/activate
```

Once you've activated your virtual environment, install the dependencies (you don't need to run this unless we add a new dependency)
``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Welcome to the project, Chaps!
